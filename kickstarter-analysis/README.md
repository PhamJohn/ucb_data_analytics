# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
###### To be able to ingest big data and drive outcome. Module 1 explores fundamentals of Excel such as built-in functions, pivot, and charts to achieve results.

## Analysis and Challenges
###### Deliverable 1: Replicate chart to Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date. Used built-in class function YEAR() to parse out years and used nested function to parse out Parent Category (did not use text to columns)

###### Deliverable 2: Replicate chart to Outcomes Based on Goals Chart. Used COUNTIFS() function and used nested function to parse  Subategory (did not use text to columns). Also in order to align the tiers created index with numeric order. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
###### At the start of the year there were more successful theater campaigns relative to failed and cancelled. By mid-year the share of successful campaigns was significantly larger than the other two. By the end of the year there were almost the same amount of successful campaigns and failed. Cancelled campaigns remained relatively low. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
###### Successful campaigns under Plays Subcategory do well with lower goals (less than 1000) +70% lead over Failed and same with goals 35000 to 40000. The data suggests goals 45000 and up Plays failed.   


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
